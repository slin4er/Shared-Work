# A simple application for recipes. This part is only about server side, so you'll find there only some simple requests, the front-end side was made by another person, if you want to use it as your local API just install it and create a config folder inside of this directory. Inside of config folder create a dev.env file where you have to provide MONGODB_URI - which is your actual atlas mongodb link, port - any port you'd like to use (by default is 3000), JWT_SECRET - any secret word for your tokens and that's it, you're good to go from there :) just write in your console npm install and then npm run dev and you'll have this api locally
